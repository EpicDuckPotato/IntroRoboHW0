    <h1>Sensing</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The main sensors we used in controlling this robot were the encoders on the motors and the camera mounted in its center. The encoders sensed the motor position, and the camera gave image feed to the driver.</p>

    <h1>Planning</h1>
  </header>
  <p>In the autonomous phase of the game, the robot had a predefined position and angle to reach with respect to its start position (its goal being to shoot a ball into a goal). It also had a predefined angle to move its arm to for shooting. We achieved the end location and angle just by hardcoding times that put it in the desired position. We commanded the motor controlling the arm to the position we wanted. In the teleop phase, the driver controlled the robot's motion remotely through a joystick.</p>

    <h1>Acting</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The robot used a differential drive, and its arm shot the ball out of its chamber by pushing it forward with a pneumatic piston and using motor-actuated wheels to "spin" the ball outward.</p>
