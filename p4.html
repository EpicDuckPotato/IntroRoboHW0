    <h1>Sensing</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The main sensors we used in controlling this robot were the encoders on the motors and the camera mounted in its center. The encoders sensed the motor position, and the camera gave image feed to the driver.</p>

    <h1>Planning</h1>
  </header>
  <p>In the autonomous phase of the game, the robot had a predefined position and angle to reach with respect to its start position (its goal being to shoot a ball into a goal). It also had a predefined angle to move its arm to for shooting. We achieved the end location and angle just by hardcoding times for forward motion (moving wheels in the forward direction at the same speed) and rotation (moving wheels in opposite directions at the same speed) that roughly put it in the desired position and angle, obtained from trial and error. We commanded the motor controlling the arm to the predefined angle, also obtained from trial and error. In the teleoperated phase, the driver controlled the robot's motion remotely through a joystick.</p>

    <h1>Acting</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The robot used a differential drive, and its arm shot the ball out of its chamber by pushing it forward with a pneumatic piston and using motor-actuated wheels to "spin" the ball outward.</p>
